# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes revolve around centralizing and standardizing organizational knowledge through a structured repository-based system, primarily housed in the `docs/` folder. Key workflows include extracting tacit insights from team members, refining them into searchable, versioned artifacts, and collaboratively iterating on documentation via GitHub's native tools. This involves creating pull requests for proposed changes, ensuring all updates are reviewed and validated before merging into the living documentation. Personas and roles are distributed across the team, with no single dependency point; contributors can propose refinements, while maintainers oversee consistency and accuracy to accelerate onboarding and enable repeatable execution.

Communication strategies emphasize transparency and equal access, leveraging GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for discussions on processes, decisions, and rationale. Issue templates stored in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` facilitate structured proposals for new or updated program process documents, allowing team members to articulate changes with clear context and rationale. This approach fosters asynchronous collaboration, where feedback loops ensure that scattered knowledge is connected and refined iteratively.

Quality assurance practices focus on version control and collaborative validation to prevent knowledge silos and ensure reliability. All documentation undergoes peer review during pull requests, with an emphasis on connecting artifacts to real-world workflows and feeding back improvements. This process reduces risks associated with tribal knowledge by creating standardized, searchable resources that support consistent project execution across the organization.
