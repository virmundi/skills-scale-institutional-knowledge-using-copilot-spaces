# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes revolve around centralizing and standardizing organizational knowledge through a structured repository-based system, primarily housed in the `docs/` folder.

**Key Workflows:**
- Extract tacit insights from team members and refine them into searchable, versioned artifacts
- Collaboratively iterate on documentation via GitHub's native tools
- Create pull requests for proposed changes, ensuring all updates are reviewed and validated before merging
- Distribute personas and roles across the team with no single dependency point
- Enable contributors to propose refinements while maintainers oversee consistency and accuracy

**Communication Strategies:**
- Emphasize transparency and equal access through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- Use issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to facilitate structured proposals
- Foster asynchronous collaboration where feedback loops connect and refine scattered knowledge iteratively

**Quality Assurance Practices:**
- Focus on version control and collaborative validation to prevent knowledge silos
- Conduct peer review for all documentation during pull requests
- Connect artifacts to real-world workflows and feed back improvements
- Reduce risks associated with tribal knowledge by creating standardized, searchable resources
